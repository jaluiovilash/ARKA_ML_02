# Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

This project applies K-means clustering to analyze and group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The main objective is to segment customers into distinct clusters, helping the business identify patterns and improve targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-inpython).

## Project Description
Customer segmentation is crucial for understanding purchase behavior and designing better customer experiences. Using K-means clustering, this project categorizes customers into specific groups based on their purchase history, revealing insights that can inform strategic marketing decisions.

### Objectives:
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and standardize the data for clustering.
- K-means Clustering: Apply and optimize the K-means algorithm to find customer segments.
- Visualization: Use visual tools to interpret and understand the clusters formed.
- Analysis: Provide insights from each cluster to identify customer traits.

## Installation
